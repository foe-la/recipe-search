# Dinner Suggestions App

This project was designed to help provide dinner suggestions based off of one food product.

## App Functionality

The user would simply type in a food to generate different options to have for dinner.
For example, if the user typed in "turkey", 10 dishes whose main ingredient is turkey would populate providing their dinner suggestions.

## Built With

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The API used was obtained from https://api.spoonacular.com/food/products. 

## Challenges

Originally I intended this app to display a link to the recipe site. I ran into some errors along the way when using the API key because of how I was formatting the key in my code. When asking for assistance, I realized that the url I was using was only for products and did not provide the recipe factor. I made a pivot and instead of the recipe finder it was turned into dinner suggestions! I am still proud of what I was able to create for my first REACT project.

## Credit

For reference I watched a few videos on YouTube from Sanskar Tiwari. I want to thank my instructor Tishana and Manara as well as my classmate Owusu for their willingness to help me through my project and keep the ball rolling!
